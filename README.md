## üéØ Overview

BDDo helps developers organize their tasks and testing scenarios using an inspired version of the Given-When-Then syntax from the Behavior-Driven Development approach. Manage your features, tasks, and test cases directly within VSCode. You can create tasks, group them in folders, and define scenarios categorized as Happy Path, Edge cases, or Error cases.
